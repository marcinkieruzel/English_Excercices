# Eredivisie 

In this excercise we use React Router Dom for routing. The topic is behind the scope of this course (we'll use next routing later) but have a look at the documentation if you're interested.

1. Our goal is to create Eredivisie tabel. 
2. Create context to keep data from the form in `Home` component
3. Make the form adds results to the context and print all result divided into rounds below the form. Of course we need to properly validate the data (prevent duplicates).
4. Base on the context count the position of each Team in `Tables`. You may use lodash sortBy function.
